    "Python is an open-sourced software. It is becoming increasingly utilized in the professional and emerging-tech world. It is one of the top 10 popular programing languages and recently passed 40 million users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The popularity of Python stems from its flexibility and ability to use API's to route 3rd party tools into processes. Python also interacts well with a myriad of other softwares including R, QGIS, ArcGIS, Git, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some reasons to use Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) It is free!\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2) Many other softwares support it\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3) Lots of free resources and guides\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4) Great for data visualization\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5) Great for automation of tasks\n",
    "    \n",
    "Python is great for programming, coding, and data science...all at the same time! However, the learning curve is higher than other softwares and may not be the best option for single use projects. R is often the better choice, for simplicity reasons, for data analytics."
